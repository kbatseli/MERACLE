MERA Constructive Layer-wise Expansion (MERACLE) for Matlab&copy;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains an object-oriented Matlab implementation of 
various Tensor Train routines. Experiments of the MERACLE paper can be 
reproduced by running the scripts

* Experiment1_converting_TT_into_Tucker.m

* Experiment2_comparison_HOSVD_with_Alg3.m

* Experiment4_comparison_compression_TT_and_MERA.m

A key contribution lies in the proposed disentangle.m algorithm that is 
able to recover orthogonal (isometric) disentangler tensors through 
iteratively solving an orthogonal Procrustes problem.

The data files required to reproduce Experiments 1 and 2 can be freely 
downloaded from https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:cb37d1b8-a505-46eb-8c42-fe819429624b.
